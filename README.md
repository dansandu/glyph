# Glyph
A simple C++ implementation of a canonical left to right parser with one lookahead terminal.
## Building and deploying the project
We'll use praline to build and deploy the project. You can get it from [here](https://github.com/dansandu/praline). Next, clone the repository to a desired directory and run the following command inside the terminal:
```
praline.py deploy
```
This will build and deploy the glyph artifact to your repository. You can now use this artifact in any praline project.
## Simple symbolic calculator
Create a new directory `calculator` in your favorite workspace directory and create a `Pralinefile` inside it with the following contents:
```
organization: foobar
artifact: calculator
version: 1.0.0
dependencies:
- organization: dansandu
  artifact: glyph
  version: 1.+0.+0
```
Run the following command inside a terminal to quickly create the project skeleton:
```
praline.py --executable main
```
The command will create a "Hello, world!" executable. We'll change this project to evaluate formulae from the command line. We'll take it step by step. In the project directory open the main source file `sources/foobar/calculator/executable.cpp` and change it to:
```
#include "dansandu/glyph/node.hpp"
#include "dansandu/glyph/parser.hpp"
#include "dansandu/glyph/regex_tokenizer.hpp"

// We use this function to perform stack pop on a vector.
template<typename T>

    stack.pop_back();
    return value;
}

// Entry point of the executable.
int main(int argumentsCount, char** arguments)

        return 0;
    }

    // This is the grammar used to parse arithmetic formulae. Non-terminals
    // start with capital letters while terminals start with lower case letters.
    // Both non-terminals and terminals are alphanumeric. Notice the indexing of
    // each production rule with comments. We'll use these indices to evaluate
    // the abstract syntax tree yielded by the parser. Another thing to be aware
    // of is why we chose this particular grammar. There are many grammars which

    // precedence is a side effect of its structure.
    // clang-format off
    const auto grammar = /*0*/ "Start    -> Sums                    \n"

                         /*5*/ "Value    -> number";
    // clang-format on

    // Create the parser from the grammar.
    const auto parser = Parser{grammar};

    // Each symbol in the grammar is mapped to an integer by the parser to speed
    // up parsing.
    const auto add = parser.getTerminalSymbol("add");
    const auto multiply = parser.getTerminalSymbol("multiply");
    const auto number = parser.getTerminalSymbol("number");
    // Whitespace doesn't influence the parsing so we can discard it from the
    // original string. This will simplify the grammar. Here the whitespace
    // symbol is mapped to a special symbol which is skipped by the parser when
    // encountered.
    const auto whitespace = parser.getDiscardedSymbolPlaceholder();

    // Because terminals are alphanumeric we need to map symbols to the their
    // actual representation in the input string. We use the regex tokenizer to
    // map terminals to patterns. The order of the patterns matters because the
    // first matching pattern is used while the rest are ignored.
    const auto tokenizer =
        RegexTokenizer{{{add, "\\+"},
                        {multiply, "\\*"},
                        {number, "(?:[1-9]\\d*|0)(?:\\.\\d+)?"},
                        {whitespace, "\\s+"}}};

    // The formula to be parsed is an arbitrary string given as a program
    // argument.
    const auto formula = std::string_view{arguments[1]};

    // Before we can parse the formula we first need to define a special
    // function which is used to evaluate the abstract syntax tree generated by

    // we avoid recursive functions. In our case a stack of doubles is
    // sufficient to store all values needed by the our parser.
    auto stack = std::vector<double>{};

    // This function visits each node in the abstract syntax tree as it is
    // generated by the parser. The node parameter can be either a token from
    // the input string or a production rule index. The left hand side
    // non-terminal of the production rule (before ->) is the result of
    // composing non-terminals and terminals from the right hand side of the

            // The only tokens we are interested in are numbers. These are the
            // only symbols which hold a value. The add and multiply terminals
            // are used in conjunction with their production rules.
            if (token.getSymbol() == number)
            {
                // Here we extract from the formula the substring which
                // represents the number. We convert it to double and push it to
                // the stack.
                const auto string =
                    std::string{formula.cbegin() + token.begin(),
                                formula.cbegin() + token.end()};
                stack.push_back(std::stod(string));
            }
        }
        else
        {
            // Now the parser has applied a production rule. The
            // node.getRuleIndex() method yields the index of the used
            // production rule. We marked with comments the index of each rule
            // for convenience. We use these indices to compose values from the
            // stack.
            switch (node.getRuleIndex())
            {
            case 1:
            {
                // The parser has applied the second production rule from the
                // grammar. This is the sum. We pop the last two values from the

                const auto rhs = pop(stack);
                const auto lhs = pop(stack);
                stack.push_back(lhs + rhs);

            {
                // This time the parser has applied the 4th rule. This is the
                // multiplication. We do just as before but this time the
                // operation is multiplication.
                const auto rhs = pop(stack);
                const auto lhs = pop(stack);
                stack.push_back(lhs * rhs);
                break;
            }
            case 0:
            case 2:
            case 4:
            case 5:
                // These production rules have no net effect on the result of
                // the formula. They just forward values.
                break;
            default:
                // All production rule indices must be handled by the switch.
                throw std::runtime_error{
                    "prodcution rule indices were not exhausted"};
            }
        }
    };

    // Tokenize the formula and the pass it to the parser.
    const auto tokens = tokenizer(formula);
    parser.parse(tokens, visitor);

    // The stack should now hold the final result of the formula.
    std::cout << formula << " = " << stack.back() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
That's the code! Now let's run it:
```
praline.py --skip-unit-tests main --arguments "3 + 5 * 10 + 40"
```
This should print something like this:
```
2019-06-11 20:26:55,749 INFO praline.common.file_system 3 + 5 * 10 + 40 = 93
```
And there you have it, a simple symbolic calculator. You can add more features like subtraction, division, powers, parenthesis, signed values, functions, etc. See `sources/dansandu/glyph/parser.test.cpp` for a more sophisticated example.
