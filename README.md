# Glyph
A simple C++ implementation of a CLR(1) parser (canonical left to right parser with one lookahead terminal).
## Building and deploying the project
The project uses praline to build and deploy the project. Praline can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/dansandu/praline). Once cloned, the project can be built and deployed using the following console command:
```
praline.py deploy
```
This will build and deploy the glyph artifact to the repository making it available to other projects.
## Simple symbolic calculator
The following is a simple symbolic calculator application. The project is a directory named `calculator` with a file inside it named `Pralinefile` that has the following contents:
```yaml
organization: foobar
artifact: calculator
version: 1.0.0
dependencies:
- organization: dansandu
  artifact: glyph
  version: 1.+0.+0
```
Running the following command inside the project directory console will quickly create the project skeleton:
```bash
praline.py --executable main
```
The command will create a "Hello, world!" executable. Moving forward, the code will be changed to evaluate formulae from the command line. In the project directory open the main source file `sources/foobar/calculator/executable.cpp` and change it to:
```cpp
#include "dansandu/glyph/node.hpp"
#include "dansandu/glyph/parser.hpp"
#include "dansandu/glyph/regex_tokenizer.hpp"

#include <vector>

```
The following command runs the application given some program arguments:
```bash
praline.py main --arguments "3 + 5 * 10 + 40"
```
The command should print something like this:
```
2019-06-11 20:26:55,749 INFO praline.common.file_system 3 + 5 * 10 + 40 = 93
```
This was the simple symbolic calculator. More features can be added such as subtraction, division, powers, parentheses, signed values, variables, functions or even a fully-fledged programming language.
